            <p>My project will have to do with a small database of songs that I have on my spotify. it will have the images of the album covers wiht some information about the song like Name, album name, artist name, length of the song, also having the lyrics on the side<br> each song will have its own page which will show all of the information. then on the main page it will only show some minimal amount of things about the songs like the name and artist I was also hoping on making it so that the album cover would be a button to bring you to the song as well as a button on the bottom of the text that will be used for more information</p>
